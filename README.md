## Current Projects:

### State Inequality:

Given data that explores the levels of wealth inequality in the U.S I was asked
to implement several visual features to help people better understand the data.

These features include:
* Dropdown selection of the year
* Dropdown selection of the metric to analyze
* A choropleth map showing the relationship of the states have with each other
   in regards to the selected year/metric
